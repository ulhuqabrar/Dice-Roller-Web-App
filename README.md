# 🎲 Dice Roller Web App

A fun, interactive, and visually engaging **Dice Roller** web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to choose how many dice to roll, then visually and numerically displays the result of each roll — perfect for games, simulations, or just some casual randomness!

---

## 📌 Overview

The app simulates the rolling of one or more dice. Users can input the number of dice they want to roll, hit the **"Roll Dice"** button, and see both the numeric results and dice face images displayed dynamically.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 Roll **1 or more dice** at once
- 🧮 Displays **numeric result** of each roll
- 🖼️ Shows **dice images** for better visual feedback
- 🎨 Styled with a bold and fun UI theme
- 💡 Fully responsive and beginner-friendly code

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters the number of dice they want to roll.
2. Clicking the **Roll Dice** button triggers the `rolldice()` function.
3. JavaScript generates a random number between 1–6 for each die.
4. The result is:
   - Displayed as a number.
   - Shown visually using matching dice face images.
